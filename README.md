# Music app with reactJS

This is music app that I made with ReactJs and Sass from scratch.
You can see the Demo of this app hereðŸ‘‰ [https://irfan-za.github.io/music-app](https://irfan-za.github.io/music-app).

How To use:
1. Click the play button to play the song.
2. Click the next or previous button to play next/previous song.
3. Click the library button to see our music library.
